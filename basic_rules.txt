1. Introduction

Construct powerful warships from scratch using your preconstructed deck and lead bold commanders into battle. Build an economic engine to fuel your war machine, control key locations, and unleash devastating Orders to dominate the system. Your ultimate goal: bring doom to your enemies' homeworlds and claim dominance over the stars.

2. Defend Your Homeworld

This is your homeworld. You must defend it from attack while simultaneously traveling across the system to destroy your opponents'.

3. Building a Spaceship

Ships in War for the Stars are constructed from individual modules, each providing specific functionality.

Power Core: powers adjacent modules
Thruster: adds thrust 
Small Laser: deal 1 damage
Armor Plating: absorbs damage

4. Energy

Adding modules to our ship costs energy. There are many ways to increase your energy supply. Power Core taps to add 2 to our energy pool. Energon Cells add 1. Some Leader characters give us energy, too.

5. Battle

When you move your ship into a hex occupied by an enemy ship, a battle ensues. During battle, ships fire their weapons at the each other. Damage is assigned to modules rather than the ship as a whole. When a module is damaged, it is disabled and ceases to function. Flip the card over to indicate disability. If a disabled module is damaged again, it is destroyed and removed from the ship and the card goes to your discard pile.

6. Stellar Objects

There are asteroids to mine for resources, and the sun represents an incredibly energy source if you can manage to exploit it.

7. Leaders

Your society is nothing without its leaders. Leaders are deployed for a small amount of energy and reside inside your ships, granting passive bonuses to your fleet. Some have abilities that trigger when they enter the battlefield.

Each ship can hold a single leader. If you want to change the leader inside a ship, simply deploy a new one there. The old one is blown out into the freezing vacuum of space, then sent to your discard pile. If you want your ship to hold more leaders, build the Living Quarters module.

8. Orders

Orders are one-off cards with dramatic effects. They are issued by Leaders and only target objects in the same hex.

There are also Standing Orders, which persist indefinitely, or until the Leader who issued them is killed.

9. Your Starting Ship

Players start with a ship from which their fleet will grow. Before the game starts, each player takes out any number of modules, leaders, and/or Standing Orders with a sum total energy cost of 10 or less, and puts them into play in a hex over their homeworld.
