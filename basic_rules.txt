1. Introduction

Construct powerful warships from scratch using your preconstructed deck and lead bold commanders into battle. Build an economic engine to fuel your war machine, control key locations, and unleash devastating Orders to dominate the system. Your ultimate goal: bring doom to your enemies' homeworlds and claim dominance over the stars.

3. Building a Spaceship

Ships in War for the Stars are constructed from individual modules, each providing specific functionality.

Power Core: powers adjacent modules
Thruster: adds thrust 
Small Laser: deal 1 damage
Armor Plating: absorbs damage

4. Energy

Adding modules to your ship costs energy, noted in the top right of cards. There are many ways to increase your energy supply. Power Core taps to add 2 to your energy pool. Energon Cells add 1. Some Leaders give energy, too.

In a two-player match, the play space contains four zones, or "Orbits": the Asteroid Belt, the Sun,  Player 1's Home world, and Player 2's Home world. These are cards laid out between the players. Players place tokens on the cards to indicate the position of their ships. Move your ships to The Sun to harness its incredible energy. Move them to The Asteroid Belt to exploit the abundant minerals. Move to your opponent's homeworld to attack and destroy it!

5. Battle

When ships do battle, they exchange fire with their weapons. Modules on ships are targeted individually for damage, so pick your targets wisely to neuter your opponent's ships!

6. Leaders

Your society is nothing without its leaders. Leaders reside inside your ships, granting passive bonuses to your fleet. Some have abilities that trigger when they enter the battlefield.

Watch out for where you station them, as leaders are killed if their module is destroyed.

7. Orders

Orders are one-off cards with dramatic effects. They are issued by Leaders and target objects in the same hex.

Standing Orders persist until the Leader who issued them is killed.

8. Your Starting Ship

Before the game starts, each player takes out any number of modules, leaders, and/or Standing Orders with a sum total energy cost of 10 or less, and puts them into play over their homeworld. This is your starting ship.
