In a two-player match, the play space contains four zones: the Asteroid Belt, the Sun,  and each player's Home world. These are cards laid out between the players. Move your ships to The Sun to harness its incredible energy. Move them to The Asteroid Belt to exploit the abundant minerals. Move to your opponent's homeworld to attack and destroy it!

5. Battle

When ships do battle, they exchange fire with their weapons. Modules on ships are targeted individually for damage, so pick your targets wisely to neuter your opponent's ships!

6. Leaders

Your society is nothing without its leaders. Leaders pilot your ships and grant bonuses to your fleet. Some have abilities that trigger when they enter the battlefield.
