1. Objective
In War for the Stars, your goal is to eliminate your opponents by destroying their home worlds. A home world is considered destroyed when all modules on its surface have been eliminated.
2. Setup and Start
Lay out the zone cards in a horizontal line in the space directly between both players. Each player's home world is represented by its own zone card. Additionally, any extra zones in play—such as the Asteroid Belt and Sun—should have their own cards. (For this setup, assume a two-player game using home worlds, the Asteroid Belt, and the Sun.)
The space immediately in front of a player is called the "Build Area". This is where they play cards to build ships.The Build Area is a rectangular grid that can be shown explicitly with a playmat without..  Each player searches their deck for any combination of Modules, Leaders, and Standing Orders with a total energy cost of 10 or less. These cards are played in the player's Build Area in any configuration of their choosing. The location of cards relative to each other is important, so once a card is played, it cannot be moved except as a game action.
Using six-sided dice, each player designates their first ship by placing a die (with the "1" side up) next to the ship. Then, on their home world's zone card, they indicate that the ship is stationed there by placing a second d6 with the same orientation.
Each player draws a starting hand of seven cards. Additionally, each player is granted one free mulligan; if they are dissatisfied with their hand, they may shuffle it back into their deck and draw a new hand of seven cards.
3. Spaceships
In War for the Stars, you build highly customized spaceships and fleets to defeat your enemies in battle. Each spaceship is constructed using hundreds of possible modules that provide unique capabilities and roles. Whether you want to create tiny, agile fighters, cloaked electronic warfare ships, massive dreadnoughts, or something entirely different, the game offers endless customization options. In fact, a well-balanced fleet comprises a variety of ship types, each performing an important role.
4. Modules
Modules have three key attributes:
• Cost: Displayed in the top-right corner, representing the credits required to play the module.
• Power Draw: Shown in the middle, indicating the amount of power the module requires.
• Effect: Described in the main text area, detailing the module’s functionality.
Modules are added to your ship during your turn. First, pay the module’s cost in credits, then place it wherever you like on your ship. If the module is placed where it can receive power equal to its Power Draw, you gain the benefits of its effects immediately. If it's not receiving enough power, flip it upside down to indicate it is "unpowered."
If you can’t afford a module's full cost, you can begin construction on it by spending two credits to play it face down. A die showing "2" is placed to indicate that the module is under construction and that two credits have been paid. You can contribute additional credits toward its construction on subsequent turns, and once the complete cost is met, flip the module face up.
5. Building Ships
A spaceship can be any combination of modules you choose, with one key requirement – it must provide the necessary power to operate those modules. Most modules require power as indicated by their Power Draw attribute, while a few modules, like the Power Core, supply power. The basic Power Core costs four credits to build, draws 0 power, and its effect reads “Supplies one power to adjacent modules.” This means that any module built adjacent to the Power Core receives one power. If that module has a Power Draw of one, it is powered and functional. However, if a module requires two or more power, an additional power source—such as another nearby Power Core—is needed.
In addition, while not strictly required, spaceships generally need to be able to move. Movement is achieved by installing modules that provide “thrust.” A spaceship with no thrust has a speed of 0. To reach a speed of 1, the spaceship must have one unit of thrust for each module it contains. For example, a small ship composed of three modules needs three thrust to achieve speed 1, while a larger ship with ten modules requires ten thrust. After meeting the base thrust requirement (one thrust per module for speed 1), each additional thrust block—defined as an amount equal to the total number of modules—raises the ship's speed by 1. For example, the small ship with three modules would have a speed of three if it had nine thrust. Extra thrust that doesn't complete a thrust block has no effect.
6. Credits
The most common way to gain credits is by using credit-producing modules on ships. For example, the Energon Cell is a basic module that provides one credit per turn. Players should include adequate credit production in their decks, or they risk running out of credits and being unable to build modules.
7. Combat
The first thing to understand about attacking is that fleets—even a single ship counts as a fleet—do not declare attacks against one another. Instead, they declare attacks against zones. Enemy ships present in those zones can individually choose to defend or retreat. Ships that retreat leave the zone, while those that defend enter into combat.
Combat between fleets essentially involves each player selecting which weapon on each ship will fire, then resolving the attacks. However, two factors complicate the process:
Firing Order: Each ship is ranked by its speed, with faster ships firing first. If two ships share the same speed, they fire simultaneously.
Exposed Side: Each player chooses which side of their ship is exposed to enemy fire. Only the weapons on the exposed side can be targeted, representing the ship rolling in space to protect its vulnerable sections.
Once every ship has fired its weapons, combat ends, and note that a player may only attack with a fleet once per turn.
For example, consider a scenario where a small fighter engages a lightly armed mining ship. The fighter has a speed of 3 and weapons that deal 2 points of damage, while the mining ship has a speed of 1 and weapons that deal 1 point of damage.
Both ships are in the Asteroid Belt—the mining ship is busy earning credits for its player, and the fighter has just arrived to engage. On the fighter’s turn, its player declares an attack on the Asteroid Belt. The mining ship’s player anticipates surviving until reinforcements arrive, so he opts to defend. Combat ensues.
First, the fighter exposes the side featuring its twin laser and armor plating. In response, the miner chooses to expose the top side of his ship, revealing his mining laser while protecting his power core and thruster. With its superior speed, the fighter declares its targets first. It targets the mining laser, dealing 2 points of damage—the first point disables the module, and the second point destroys it. The miner then removes the destroyed card and places it in his discard pile.
If the mining ship had a weapon, it would now have a chance to attack. Since it doesn’t, combat ends. On the fighter’s next turn, he can attack again, but he has already accomplished his primary mission, which was to put an end to the mining.
8. Ramming
For one ship to ram another, the ramming ship must have at least one more speed than its target. After both sides have fired all weapons, a player may declare their intent to ram with one or more ships, specifying which ships are ramming which targets. The defender then chooses which side of each of their ships will be rammed. The attacking ships always take damage on their nose (top side). Damage is then dealt: both the ramming and the rammed ships take damage equal to half the number of modules on the ramming ship, rounded down. Damage is applied starting at the target area and then progresses backward through both ships, in the direction opposite to the ram.
This rule rewards careful ship design—if you intend to use ramming offensively, you must invest in extra speed and heavy forward armor to minimize self-damage.
9. Boarding Actions
A ship must have a Garrison module to initiate boarding actions. When a ship equipped with a Garrison module rams a second ship, any Leaders on the attacking ship may choose to board the target vessel in an attempt to seize control. The attacking ship selects any number of its Leaders to participate in the boarding action. To resolve the boarding, first calculate the total strength for both parties—the boarders and the defenders—by summing each Leader’s strength score, and add a bonus of 2 from the Garrison module for the boarding party. Then, compare the total strength scores. If the boarding party's strength is greater than that of the defenders, the boarders gain control of the target ship (or what remains of it).
Additionally, if a ship has zero movement, it can be boarded without being rammed. In this case, the attacker simply declares that they are boarding the stationary ship, and the boarding action begins after all weapons have been fired.
10. Salvage
A ship that is adrift—having no power, no thrust, and no Leaders onboard—can be salvaged by any ship in the same zone equipped with a Salvage Crew module. The salvaging ship may target any exposed, undamaged module on the incapacitated ship.. Successfully salvaged modules are removed from the board and added to the salvaging player's hand. Note that disabled modules on adrift ships can be targeted and destroyed, but they cannot be salvaged.
For example, suppose an adrift ship has a Power Core that you wish to salvage, but it is completely surrounded by disabled Armor Plating modules, rendering it unexposed. In that case, you must first spend one turn destroying one of the surrounding Armor Plating modules to expose the Power Core. Once exposed, you may then salvage the Power Core.
11. Movement
Ships exist within zones, with no internal spatial positioning—every ship simply occupies its zone. They may coexist peacefully as long as no one declares an attack. Any ship with a movement speed of 1 or greater can move between zones. When a player declares, "This ship (or fleet) is moving to [target zone]," the ship(s) leave their current zone and are placed in an intermediary "In Transit" zone. At the start of that player's next turn, they are moved from the In Transit zone to the designated target zone. Whatever special effects exist in that zone immediately take effect.
If a ship retreats from a zone, it does so in disarray. In that case, the ship arrives in the new zone at the end of the player's next turn, rather than at the beginning.
All zone-to-zone movement is treated equally—there is no notion of distance. Ships can also move freely to an enemy's home zone without automatically triggering combat; combat only occurs if either player explicitly declares an attack.
12. Attacking a Homeworld
Attacking a homeworld is a decisive move aimed at eliminating an opponent. In War for the Stars, each player’s homeworld is the core of their empire, represented by a zone card. Note that moving a fleet to an enemy homeworld and declaring an attack are separate actions—a fleet may enter an enemy homeworld without automatically initiating combat. When a fleet does declare an attack, standard combat rules apply. The defender must decide whether to remain and defend or to retreat. Modules on the homeworld's surface are treated as a ship and can be targeted like any others. As combat unfolds, damage is inflicted on modules positioned on the homeworld. Once all modules on a homeworld have been destroyed, the homeworld is considered eliminated, and its owner is defeated.
13. Leaders
Leaders are characters deployed into your ships to command them, grant special bonuses, and enhance their abilities. A ship cannot move or attack without a Leader. You deploy leaders during your turn by paying their cost in credits. Leaders can only be deployed on ships located in your home world zone. When deploying a leader, you must choose the module on the ship that they will occupy. A module may host any number of leaders, and a ship can accommodate multiple leaders. However, if a module is destroyed, any leaders assigned to it are also eliminated. At the start of your turn, you may reposition any number of leaders by moving them to a different module or even to another ship within the same zone, though you cannot move leaders between zones.
14. Orders
Orders are one-off actions issued by your leaders that produce immediate, dramatic effects on the battlefield. When you play an Order card, its effect resolves instantly. These effects can range from launching missile barrages and executing tactical maneuvers to facilitating supply shipments—each designed to turn the tide of battle in your favor. Importantly, an Order can only target objects in the same zone as the leader who issued it. Even more importantly, Orders can be issued during an opponent's turn in response to any action or Order given by that opponent. After an Order is completed, it is moved to the discard pile.
15. Standing Orders
Standing Orders are persistent effects issued by your leaders that remain active on the battlefield. Unlike Orders, which resolve immediately and are then discarded, Standing Orders continue to influence the game, providing ongoing benefits or imposing continuous effects. They can enhance your ships' capabilities, restrict enemy actions, or otherwise affect the flow of combat. When the Leader who issued the Standing Order is killed, the Standing Order is moved to the discard pile. 
16. Deckbuilding
Decks in War for the Stars
• Must contain at least one hundred cards
• May include any number of copies of any card. 
A successful deck strikes a balance between offense, defense, and resource generation, ensuring you have the tools needed to build powerful ships and execute strategic maneuvers. When constructing your deck, consider the energy cost limits and the synergies between cards. Experimentation and playtesting are key to discovering the optimal mix for your play style, as well as adapting to the evolving strategies of your opponents.
