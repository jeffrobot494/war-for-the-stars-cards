1. Objective
In War for the Stars, your goal is to eliminate your opponents by dealing five damage to their Homeworld and destroying it.

2. Setup and Start
Lay out the zone cards in a horizontal line in the space directly between both players. Each player's home world is represented by its own zone card. Additionally, any extra zones in play—such as the Asteroid Belt and Sun—should have their own cards. (For this setup, assume a two-player game using home worlds, the Asteroid Belt, and the Sun.)
The space immediately in front of a player is called the "Build Area". This is where they play cards to build ships.

Next both players take a Leader card out of their deck and put it into their hand. This is their general.

Then each player draws a starting hand of six cards for a total of seven including their general. Players are granted one free mulligan; if you are dissatisfied with your hand, you may shuffle it back into your deck and draw a second set of six cards. Keep your general in your hand.

3. Spaceships
Spaceships are one or more modules built at your Homeworld. You may build as many different spaceships as you want. When playing a module from your hand,  declare whether it's going onto one of your existing ships, or starting a new one. 
To help all players keep track of spaceships, put a six-sided die next to each of your ships, with the face turned up to a different number for each ship. In this way you denote a ship 1, 2, 3 etc. 

4. Modules
Modules have three key attributes:
• Cost: Displayed in the top-right corner, representing the energy required to play the module.
• Tier: This is the amount of damage required to disable the module. Also a general descriptor of the module's power level.
• Effect: Described in the main text area, detailing the module’s functionality.
Modules are added to your ship during your turn. First, pay the module’s cost in credits, then place it wherever you like on your ship. Your ship gains its effect immediately.
If you can’t afford a module's full cost, you can begin construction on it by spending two energy to play it face down. You can contribute additional energy toward its construction on subsequent turns, and once the complete cost is met, flip the module face up.

5. Thrust
Movement is achieved by installing modules that add “thrust.” A spaceship with no thrust has a speed of 0. To reach a speed of 1, the spaceship must have one thrust for each of its modules. For example, a small ship of three modules needs three thrust to achieve speed 1, while a larger ship with ten modules requires ten thrust. For each additional speed, a ship needs one thrust per module. For example, if the small ship with three modules had six thrust, it would have two speed.

6. Energy
Your Homeworld gives you a small amount of energy at the start of your turn. You can increase your energy supply by building certain modules. For example, the Energon Cell taps to add energy.

7. Combat
Ships in the same zone may attack one another. To declare an attack, choose which of your ships are attacking, and which enemy ship is being attacked. In response, the player being attacked, known as the defending player, chooses which, if any, of their other ships in the zone they'll add to the combat.

Next, find the speeds of all ships in the combat and order them from fastest to slowest.

Next, both players declare targets. For each weapon on each ship, declare at which ship it's firing and at which module on board that ship.

Next resolve attacks in order of fastest to slowest. If a weapon is destroyed by a ship earlier in the order, it doesn't fire.

For example, consider a scenario where a small fighter engages a lightly armed mining ship. The fighter has a speed of 3 and weapons that deal 2 points of damage, while the mining ship has a speed of 1 and weapons that deal 1 point of damage.

Both ships are in the Asteroid Belt—the mining ship is busy earning credits for its player, and the fighter has just arrived to engage. On the fighter’s turn, its player declares an attack on the mining ship. 

First players order their ships by speed: the fighter is faster and will attack first. The fighter targets the mining ship's only weapon, its mining laser. The mining ship targets the fighter's Twin Laser. Then players begin resolving damage. The fighter deals 2 points of damage to the Mining Laser—the first point disables the module, and the second point destroys it. The miner then removes the destroyed card and places it in his discard pile.

Now it's the mining ship's turn to fire, but its weapon is destroyed, so it cannot.

Once every ship has fired its weapons, before combat ends, players may declare one or more of their ships is ramming an enemy ship.

8 Targeting Modules
Every ship has a bow (top), stern (bottom), and port (left) and starboard (right) sides. When a single ship is targeting modules on an enemy ship, it can only target modules on the bow of the ship. This is because we assume the pilots of both ships fly in ways to minimize exposure of their vital modules to enemy fire.

However, when two ships fight a single ship, the second ship is able to target modules on either the port of starboard side. This is to simulate two ships being able to coordinate and attack from opposite angles. The defending player chooses which ship has access to their port and starboard modules. A third ship in the combat can also target port and starboard modules. A fourth ship targeting will be able to target stern modules.

9. Ramming
For one ship to ram another, the ramming ship must have at least one more speed than its target. In combat, after both sides have fired all weapons, a player may declare their intent to ram with one or more ships, specifying which ships are ramming which ships. A ram attack targets modules just like a weapons-based attack. Ships can only ram the side of an enemy ship they fired their weapons at. If they didn't fire weapons, figure which side they can ram based on the rules for number of ships and targeting. Damage dealt is equal to one half the number of modules on the ramming ship, rounded up. Damage is applied to both ships. Damage to the ramming ship is always applied to the bow.

9. Boarding Actions
A ship must have a Garrison module to initiate boarding actions. When a ship equipped with a Garrison module rams a second ship, any Leaders on the attacking ship may choose to board the target vessel in an attempt to seize control. The attacking ship selects any number of its Leaders to participate in the boarding action. A boarding action is successful if the boarding Leaders outnumber the Leaders on the defending ship. If the action is successful, control of the ship immediately changes to the attacking player. The new commander may execute the old Leaders of the ship. If the boarding action is unsuccessful, all attacking Leaders involved are killed.

11. Movement
Ships exist within zones, with no internal spatial positioning—every ship simply occupies its zone. They may coexist peacefully as long as no one declares an attack. Any ship with a movement speed of 1 or greater can move between zones. Movement is done at the end of the turn. Players declare they are entering the "movement" phase, then declare which, if any, of their ships are moving and to where. A player may move any number of their ships. After declaring their movements, the movements are completed, and the player's turn ends.

12. Attacking a Homeworld
Attacking a homeworld is a decisive move aimed at eliminating an opponent. Attacks against Homeworlds follow the same rules as attacks against other ships. When I attack your Homeworld, you may add any ships you command in the zone to the combat. As the attacker, treat the Homeworld like an enemy ship with only a single module, the Homeworld itself. After a Homeworld has been dealt five total damage, it is destroyed and its player is eliminated.

13. Leaders
Leaders are characters deployed into your ships to command them, grant special bonuses, and enhance their abilities. A ship cannot move or attack without a Leader, though it can defend. You deploy leaders during your turn by paying their cost in energy. Leaders can only be deployed on any ship you command in any zone. When deploying a leader, you must choose the module on the ship that they will occupy. A module may host any number of leaders, and a ship can accommodate multiple leaders. However, if a module is destroyed, any leaders assigned to it are also eliminated. At the start of your turn, you may reposition any number of leaders by moving them to a different module or even to another ship within the same zone, though you cannot move leaders between zones.

14. Orders
Orders are one-off actions issued by your leaders that produce immediate, dramatic effects on the battlefield. When you play an Order card, its effect resolves instantly. These effects can range from launching missile barrages and executing tactical maneuvers to facilitating supply shipments—each designed to turn the tide of battle in your favor. Importantly, an Order can only target objects in the same zone as the leader who issued it. Even more importantly, Orders can be issued during an opponent's turn in response to any action or Order given by that opponent. After an Order is completed, it is moved to the discard pile.

15. Standing Orders
Standing Orders are persistent effects issued by your leaders that remain active on the battlefield. Unlike Orders, which resolve immediately and are then discarded, Standing Orders continue to influence the game, providing ongoing benefits or imposing continuous effects. They can enhance your ships' capabilities, restrict enemy actions, or otherwise affect the flow of combat. When the Leader who issued the Standing Order is killed, the Standing Order is moved to the discard pile. 

16. Deckbuilding
Decks in War for the Stars
• Must contain at least one hundred cards
• May include any number of copies of any card. 
A successful deck strikes a balance between offense, defense, and resource generation, ensuring you have the tools needed to build powerful ships and execute strategic maneuvers. When constructing your deck, consider the energy cost limits and the synergies between cards. Experimentation and playtesting are key to discovering the optimal mix for your play style, as well as adapting to the evolving strategies of your opponents.
